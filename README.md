## Installation
In singleplayer, install as normal. 
In multiplayer, you only need to install the mod on the server (client-side will have no effect). 
If you want the item to display the correct texture and name, you also need to add [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) on the server and [enable AutoHost](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/). 
Otherwise, the it will use the rabbit hide texture.
