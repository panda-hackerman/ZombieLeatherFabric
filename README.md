A super simple server-side mod for Fabric that adds the ability to turn rotten flesh into leather.

## Features
- Using a campfire, you can turn rotten flesh into smoked rotten flesh, which can then be crafted into leather.
- Leatherworker villagers will trade smoked rotten flesh for emeralds.

## Installation
Zombie Leather is a *server-side only* mod. When installed on a server, players can connect without installing anything. Installing on the client has no effect.

Assuming your server is already running a compatible version of [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/server/) and the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), then you should be able to just drop the jar into your mods folder!

You should also install [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) to host the resource pack for clients. It's optional, but highly recommended. Otherwise, the Smoked Rotten Flesh will use the rabbit hide texture by default.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Polymer, make sure to [enable AutoHost](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/).
> You can also mark it as required, which prevents players from connecting without downloading the pack.
